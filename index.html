								<p>A smart universal motion control system might pave a way to achieve the form of touchless interaction.With the use of motion sensors, we can control various devices such as laptops, Smartphones, televisions, projectors and so on. To implement motion sensing we use AI combined with machine learning to recognize the hand movements and recognize the commands. We make use of libraries such as OpenCV to access the webcam in case of using the laptop’s inbuilt webcam for basic implementation. We can use mediapipe, tensor flow, Numpy libraries for detection of hand movements. The device works based on AI with the help of ML. The Media pipe library of the python program is used to detect the 21 key points in each hand as it comes with pre-trained machine learning solutions.<br>

								<p>Text extraction using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a process of recognizing and extracting text from images or scanned documents. OCR technology is widely used in industries such as banking, healthcare, legal, and education to digitize and automate document processing. However, OCR accuracy can be affected by various factors such as image quality, font, language, and layout. To improve OCR accuracy, a Machine Learning (ML) model can be trained to recognize and extract text from images.<br>
								</p>Used a pre-trained language model developed by Microsoft Research that can be fine-tuned for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, and text extraction. The software is unique in that it can recognize and extract text while preserving the layout and structure of the document. This is particularly useful for documents with complex layouts such as forms, invoices, and receipts. Utilized this resources to build a model for sroie dataset

								<p>The project involved building a Tableau dashboard for analyzing bird strike data with airplanes in the USA. The dashboard was designed to provide users with a comprehensive view of the bird strike data and enable them to identify patterns and trends in the data.The dashboard included various visualizations, such as maps, charts, and graphs, to help users understand the data better. The maps showed the locations where bird strikes occurred, while the charts and graphs displayed the frequency of bird strikes, the types of birds involved, the aircraft types, and the severity of the incidents.<br>
								</p>The dashboard also allowed users to filter the data by various parameters, such as location, date range, and aircraft type, to obtain more specific insights. The dashboard was designed to be user-friendly, with interactive features that allowed users to explore the data in depth.Overall, the Tableau dashboard provided a powerful tool for analyzing bird strike data with airplanes in the USA, enabling users to identify patterns and trends in the data and make informed decisions to mitigate the risks of bird strikes.

								<p>The project involved developing and training a deep learning model for accurately predicting the health of potato crops. The model was trained using data from multiple sources, which allowed for a more comprehensive analysis of the health of the crops. The deep learning model was trained using a large dataset of potato crop images, which were labeled based on their health status. The model was designed to recognize patterns in the images and accurately classify them as healthy or unhealthy. The model achieved high levels of accuracy in predicting the health of potato crops, and the platform provided a scalable and efficient solution for real-time analysis. This project has the potential to significantly improve potato crop yields and reduce crop losses, helping to ensure a more sustainable and secure food supply.<br>
								</p>Further working on API integration for real-time analysis of potato crop health, providing farmers with up-to-date information about the health of their crops. The platform was designed to be scalable, allowing for easy integration with other systems and data sources. This allowed farmers to easily incorporate the platform into their existing workflows, and provided them with a powerful tool for managing their potato crops.Overall, the project demonstrated the power of deep learning and API integration for improving crop health analysis.

								<p>The project involved building a machine learning regression model to identify house prices based on various factors. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) methods were used to analyze and visualize the data, which helped in identifying the important features that could affect the house prices. Ensemble methods were implemented using pipelines to create the model. The machine learning regression model used various algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests to predict the house prices. Different ensemble methods such as stacking and blending were used to improve the model's accuracy. The model was also fine-tuned using hyperparameter optimization techniques to optimize the model's performance.<br>
								</p>The EDA methods involved analyzing the data to identify patterns, relationships, and outliers that could affect the house prices. Mathplotlib was used to visualize the data and create different graphs such as histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots. These visualizations helped in identifying the important features that could be used to predict the house prices accurately.Overall, the project demonstrated the power of machine learning regression models in predicting house prices accurately. The use of EDA methods and ensemble methods along with pipelines helped in improving the model's accuracy significantly. The use of Mathplotlib to visualize the data helped in identifying the important features that could affect the house prices. This project has the potential to help real estate professionals in predicting house prices more accurately and make better investment decisions.
